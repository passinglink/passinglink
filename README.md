## Passing Link
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/passinglink/passinglink.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/passinglink/passinglink)

Passing Link is an open source game controller firmware implementation focused on minimizing latency and supporting inexpensive development boards. Currently, the latency as measured by [WydD](https://twitter.com/wydd)'s [usblag](https://gitlab.com/loic.petit/usblag) project is around 0.95ms.

### Features
- USB output
  - PS3 output
  - PS4 output, with controller authentication supported with [extracted keys](https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2018/ps4-ds4/)
  - Nintendo Switch output (thanks to [progmem](https://github.com/progmem) for [researching Switch controllers](https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick))
  - PC output via PS4
  - Console autodetection (detects Switch and PS3, with fallback to PS4)
- Razer Panthera touchpad support

### Future Goals
- Unimplemented hardware support
  - PS4 audio output
- Firmware update via USB DFU
- Act as a USB decoder/converter
  - Input/output over SPI
  - USB input

### Compiling
```
# Install tool dependencies
apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends build-essential cmake git ninja-build python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-pyelftools wget

# Install the Zephyr SDK
ZEPHYR_SDK_VERSION=0.11.1
export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=~/zephyr-sdk
wget https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v${ZEPHYR_SDK_VERSION}/zephyr-sdk-${ZEPHYR_SDK_VERSION}-setup.run
sh zephyr-sdk-${ZEPHYR_SDK_VERSION}-setup.run -- -d $ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR

# Install west, Zephyr's source management tool
pip3 install west

# Checkout the source
west init -m https://github.com/passinglink/passinglink passinglink
cd passinglink
west update

# Build and flash
cd passinglink
west build -b pl_bluepill && west flash

```


### Supported hardware
Passing Link is based on the widely supported Zephyr RTOS with no specific hardware requirements, so it should be portable to a wide variety of microcontrollers. The following is a list of microcontrollers/development boards that are actively used for development:

- [Custom PCB with STM32F103RE](https://github.com/passinglink/pcb)
  - 72MHz, 64kB RAM, 512kB flash
   - Primary development target: the raw microcontroller can be acquired from AliExpress for under $2 each shipped
- RobotDyn STM32F303 Black Pill
  - 72 MHz, 40kB RAM, 256 kB flash
  - [$4.59 from RobotDyn](https://robotdyn.com/stm32f303cct6-256-kb-flash-stm32-arm-cortexr-m4-mini-system-dev-board-3326a9dd-3c19-11e9-910a-901b0ebb3621.html)
- Particle Xenon (nRF52840)
  - 64MHz, 256kB RAM, 1MB flash
  - Bluetooth LE support (but not useful for implementing a wireless controller, because of missing Bluetooth Classic support)
  - [$11 from Particle](https://store.particle.io/products/xenon), but discontinued
- Generic STM32F103 Bluepill boards
  - 72MHz, 20kB RAM, 64kB flash
  - Recommended against due to resource constraints, but will be supported for as long as is feasible
  - [$3 from RobotDyn](https://robotdyn.com/stm32f103-stm32-arm-mini-system-dev-board-stm-firmware.html)
- STM32F4 Discovery board (STM32F407VG)
  - 168MHz, 128kB RAM + 64kB CCM, 1MB flash
  - 2 USB controllers (currently only 1 can be used).
  - [~$22 from Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/STM32F407G-DISC1/5824404). Cheaper option should be available elsewhere.
